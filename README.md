# DALL·E Mini
[DALL·E Mini](https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-min) generates a lot of fun. While it's great for brainstorming and inspiration the end users always suffer from the "Too many traffic" error. This aim to enhance a bit on client side byadding retry mechanism such that end users can just wait for the result without pressing buttons.

This project is just a consumer of the API. It doesnt implement anything about AI. It's just a website calling remote API.

The project is built by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

You can access the fun [here](https://shawtim.github.io/dall-e-mini-web/).
